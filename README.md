As an experimental physicist, I have worked on diverse projects, including academic research and industry-oriented applications, leveraging systematic experimental design, mathematical models, and programming to deeply understand and solve concrete problems. I am highly motivated, and enjoy taking on new challenges, quickly learning whatever is needed to tackle them. With over five years of experience teaching physics at the university level and a strong foundation in outreach activities, I have developed excellent communication skills, allowing me to effectively translate technical information for non-scientific audiences.
