# About me
I am Federico Trupp, PhD in physics, specilized in polymers and composite materials, and data scientist.

As an experimental physicist, I have worked on diverse projects, including academic research and industry-oriented applications, leveraging systematic experimental design, mathematical models, and machine learning models to deeply understand and solve concrete problems. I am highly motivated, and enjoy taking on new challenges, quickly learning whatever is needed to tackle them. With over five years of experience teaching physics at the university level and a strong foundation in outreach activities, I have developed the communication skills to effectively translate technical information for non-scientific audiences.
